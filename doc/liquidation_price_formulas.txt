This calculation is approx but less than 0.5% accurate than the real calculation
which is way more complex. See liquidation_price.py in the root of this project
for the real formulas. This is good enough for everyday use.

entry_price = ...
quantity = ...
leverage = ... (for example 10 for 10x)

order_value = quantity / entry_price

cost = order_value / leverage

price = (order_value + cost) / quantity

liquidation_price = 1 / price
