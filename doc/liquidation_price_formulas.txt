This calculation is approx but less than 0.5% accurate than the real calculation
which is way more complex. See liquidation_price.py in the root of this project
for the real formulas. This is good enough for everyday use.

entry_price = ...
quantity = ...
leverage = ... (for example 10 for 10x)

liquidation_price = entry_price * leverage / (leverage + 1)

With Margin
###########

Formula is slightly more complicated:

  order_value = quantity / entry_price
  liquidation_value = quantity / liquidation_price
  initial_margin = order_value / leverage

We then have to calculate using the PNL equation so loss is not greater than margin (or BitMex will lose money since we are bankrupt):

  order_value - liquidation_value = -(added_margin + initial_margin)

Use this equation to find liquidation_value, then convert to liquidation_price.

The final formulas are:

  order_value = quantity / entry_price
  initial_margin = order_value / leverage
  liquidation_value = order_value + added_margin + initial_margin
  liquidation_price = quantity / liquidation_value
