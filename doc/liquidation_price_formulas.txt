This calculation is approx but less than 0.5% accurate than the real calculation
which is way more complex. See liquidation_price.py in the root of this project
for the real formulas. This is good enough for everyday use.

entry_price = ...
quantity = ...
leverage = ... (for example 10 for 10x)

liquidation_price = entry_price * leverage / (leverage + 1)

With Margin
###########

Formula is slightly more complicated:

order_value = quantity / entry_price

                                        quantity
liquidation_price =  ----------------------------------------------
                                      order_value
                       order_value + ------------- + added_margin
                                       leverage
